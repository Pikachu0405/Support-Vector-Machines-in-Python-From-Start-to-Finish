# Support-Vector-Machines-in-Python-From-Start-to-Finish

1. Import data into, and manipulating a pandas dataframe

2. Format the data for a support vector machine, including One-Hot Encoding and missing data.

3. Optimize parameters for the radial basis function and classification

4. Build, evaluate, draw and interpret a support vector machine


**Project Implementation and Takeaways --**

1. Import the data
2. Missing Data Part 1: Identifying Missing Data
3. Missing Data Part 2: Dealing With Missing Data
4. Format Data Part 1: Split the Data into Dependent and Independent Variables
5. Format the Data Part 2: One-Hot Encoding
6. Format the Data Part 3: Centering and Scaling
7. Build A Preliminary Support Vector Machine
8. Optimize Parameters with Cross Validation
9. Building, Evaluating, Drawing, and Interpreting the Final Support Vector Machine
